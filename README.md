# Placement-Predictor-Model

The **Placement-Predictor-Model** is a machine learning model designed to predict whether a student will be able to secure a placement based on their CGPA and IQ. This model employs logistic regression to make accurate predictions.

## Overview

Securing placements is a crucial milestone for students, and various factors contribute to their likelihood of success. This model aims to predict placement outcomes by analyzing two key features:
- **CGPA (Cumulative Grade Point Average)**
- **IQ (Intelligence Quotient)**

By leveraging logistic regression, the model classifies students into two categories:
- **Placed** Denoted by 1
- **Not Placed** Denoted by 0

## Features

- **Predictive Analysis**: Uses logistic regression to predict placement outcomes based on CGPA and IQ.
- **Binary Classification**: Classifies students into "Placed" or "Not Placed" categories.
- **Feature Importance**: Highlights the significance of CGPA and IQ in determining placement success.

## Requirements

To run the Placement-Predictor-Model, you need the following dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Numpy
